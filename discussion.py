PART 1: DISCUSSION QUESTIONS

RECURSION

1.  Recursion is a function that calls itself. When it reaches the Base Case, it returns a value, but it needs to return previous functions and close them. This is like Russian nesting dolls that open but need to close each one when it goes back.

2.  It is necessary to have a Base Case to know when recursion is done. If there is no Base Case, a Runtime Error will occur.
